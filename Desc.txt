When kernel-mode authentication is disabled, the request is passed through to user-mode and IIS 7/7.5 performs the authentication. The user token established in this case will be that of the actual user, and impersonation occurs with this identity instead of the application pool identity.

Therefore, when kernel-mode authentication is enabled, you might see the identity of the application pool in some of your application's HTTP contexts, because the kernel mode can pre-authenticate incoming requests under this account.
